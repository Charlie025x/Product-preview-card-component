## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This projected was a great exercise as I have not coded a page to design in quite a while. Durring the project I had learned that hsl color values could easily be adjusted to shades closer to either black or white by changing the final value of the hsl code.

### Continued development

I would like to incorporate css local variables in my styling. I seen local varibles used to set a commonly used value and make adjusting multiple instances of that variable instantaneous.
Another tool I want to implement into my regular markup are data attributes. I currently understand data attributes to be a handy selector, separate from html Classes and IDs.

Css varibles and data attributes are 2 subjects I will be looking into.

### Useful resources
